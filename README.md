# Cll

I use this shortcut for many years to easily write print lines. At the
beginning only for Javascript, hence the name `cll`, it stands for console log.
Then I also used it for Rust, because `println!("{:?}", ...)` is so hard to
write. Then for all my other favorite languages or which I have to use in my
job.

## Usage

Just type `cll` in insert, normal or visual mode and a print line will appear.
